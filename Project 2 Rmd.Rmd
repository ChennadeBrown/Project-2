## Introduction

Our project involves creating predictive models and automating Markdown reports for each article topic (Lifestyle, Social Media, Business, World, Entertainment, and Technology) using the [Online News Popularity Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity). This dataset contains quantitative information including the number of words, images, and links, as well as qualitative information such as article topic and day published. The goal of this report is to predict the number of shares for each article topic using linear regression, random forest, and boosted tree models. Our team used 55 prediction attributes for ensemble methods and a combination of the following attributes for linear regression to predict article shares:

`n_tokens_title` : Number of words in the title
`n_tokens_content` : Number of words in the content
`rate_positive_words` : Rate of positive words among non-neutral tokens
`num_hrefs` : Number of links
`num_imgs` : Number of images
`num_keywords` : Number of keywords in the metadata
`global_subjectivity` : Text subjectivity
`max_positive_polarity` : Max. polarity of positive words
`num_imgs` : Number of images
`kw_avg_avg` : Avg. keyword (avg. shares)
`kw_min_avg` : Avg. keyword (min. shares)
`kw_max_avg` : Avg. keyword (max. shares)

onlineNewsTrain <- onlineNewsLifestyle[trainIndex, ]

```

### Linear Regression Models
A linear regression model is a model used to determine the relationship between two or more variables by fitting a linear equation to the data.  The linear equation is in the form of: Y = Bo + B1X + E where Y is the response variable, X is the explanatory variable, Bo is the y intercept, and B1 is the slope.  The model can be used to predict the value of the response variable based on the values of the explanatory variables.  For example a linear regression model can be used to model the relationship between years of experience and salary.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Store model one in a formula.
modelOne <- as.formula("shares ~ n_tokens_content + n_tokens_title + rate_positive_words + num_keywords + global_subjectivity + max_positive_polarity + num_imgs")

# Fit the linear regression models.
fit1 <- train(modelOne, data = onlineNewsTrain,
              method = "lm",
              preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
              trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))
fit1
```

### Random Forest Model
Random Forest models are an extension of the tree based method bagging.  The random forest algorithm creates multiple trees from bootstrapped samples, averages those results, and uses a random subset of predictors for each bootstrap sample/tree fit.  Random forests can be used for classification and regression problems.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
rfFit <- train(shares ~., data = onlineNewsTrain, 
               method = "rf", 
               trainControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                                           number = 5),
               tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = 1:8))
rfFit
```

## Comparison

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Compare linear regression model fit1 on the test set.
pred <- predict(fit1, newdata = onlineNewsTest)
postResample(pred, obs = onlineNewsTest$shares)

# Compare random forest model rfFit on the test set.
predForest <- predict(rfFit, newdata = onlineNewsTest)
postResample(predForest, onlineNewsTest$shares)
```
### Linear Regression Model

```{r}
# Set seed and split the data into 70% training and 30% test
set.seed(100)
index <- createDataPartition(onlineNewsLifestyle$shares, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train <- onlineNewsLifestyle[index,]
test <- onlineNewsLifestyle[-index,]

# Backward selection better than best subset for this dataset. 5 variables were chosen
model <- as.formula("shares ~ kw_avg_avg + kw_min_avg + kw_max_avg + num_hrefs + n_tokens_content")

# Model fit on training data
fit <- train(model, data = train,
              method = "lm",
              preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
              trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10))
```

### Boosted Tree Model
Boosting is an ensemble tree-based method that seeks to improve prediction by training on decision trees which are grown sequentially. Each subsequent tree is grown on a modified version of the original data. The predictions are then updated as new trees are grown, minimizing the error of the previous tree. 

```{r}
# Boosted tree. After examining ranges of values for number of trees and interaction depth, 25 trees with an interaction depth of 1 had the lowest test RMSE.
boostedTree <- train(shares ~. -data_channel_is_lifestyle, data = train,
             method = "gbm",
             preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
             trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5,
                                      repeats = 3),
             tuneGrid = expand.grid(n.trees = 25, interaction.depth = 1, shrinkage = 0.1, n.minobsinnode = 10))
```

## Comparisons

```{r}
# Test error computed for backwards selection linear model
pred <- predict(fit, newdata = test)
p <- postResample(pred, obs = test$shares)

# Test error computed for boosted tree model
pred <- predict(boostedTree, newdata = test)
p2 <- postResample(pred, obs = test$shares)

# Produce a table for all comparisons
comparisons <- t(rbind(p[1],p2[1]))
colnames(comparisons) <- c("Linear Model Backwards Selection", "Boosted Tree")
comparisons
```
